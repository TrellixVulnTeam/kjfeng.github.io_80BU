          <h2>The Design of Everyday Things</h2>
          <h4>By Donald A. Norman</h4>
        </div>


        <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-8 content">

          <p>Although the some of the technology mentioned is hilariously out of date, the design principles covered by Norman are certainly not. A couple resonated with me:</p>

  <p>1) “It doesn’t matter that you may have used the device a hundred times successfully - it is the one time you got embarrassed that will come to mind.” The user will remember the design flaws much more clearly than design strengths, so even if a product is well-designed, it will not be truly delightful to the user unless all facets of the product are thoroughly user tested.</p>

  <p>2) The importance of designing while keeping in mind what the user already knows and is familiar with. “We make decisions based upon what is in our memory; memory is biased toward overgeneralization and overregulation of the commonplace and overemphasis on the discrepant.” This includes following natural mappings between intentions/actions, actions/resulting effects, and visible info/interpreted information.</p>

  <p>I also enjoyed Norman’s breakdown of each design through anecdotes; it’s an engaging and intuitive narrative that does a great job of putting the reader in the perspective of products' users rather than designers. Norman makes a distinction between needs of users and needs designers assume from users, which I appreciated. I found that this is not only a book that talks about good and bad design, but also uses its narrative style to guide readers into adapting a thoughtful, user-centered analysis to design problems.
