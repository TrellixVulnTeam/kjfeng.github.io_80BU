It just felt like kind of a pity.</p>\n\n        <h3>A Reverse Hackathon</h3>\n        <p>Rehack was born out of the desire bring together students with different backgrounds and experiences to develop creative solutions that would make modern consumer tech products more fair, humane, and socially responsible. Rehack's mission is to empower students to critially examine technology around them and articulate their thoughts by prototyping solutions to the problems they see. I got together a small team of 10, and after a year of hard work, productive conversations, and non-stop fundraising, we made Rehack a reality.</p>\n\n        <p>There are countless components involved in making Rehack successful both as an organization and as an event, but I want to touch on a particular component that I focused on heavily since the very beginning: the visual identity.</p>\n\n        <h3>Constructing Rehack's Visual Identity</h3>\n        <p>I started by reflecting on the intent and goals behind Rehack and where exactly I wanted to take it. I experimented with logomarks, logotypes, and a combination of the two. I also played around with different graphical forms, particularly one of the brain because it embodies two of Rehack's main values (mindfulness and innovation) and is widely recognizable. I also tried to incorporate \"reverse\" meaningfully, as that was one of Rehack's unique points. The initial work was all done in black and white to make an isolated decision on form. You can see some of the early efforts in the initial Illustrator planning document.</p>\n\n        <figure>\n          <img className=\"full-width-img\" src={ require(\"./img/rehack-0.png\").default }></img>\n          <figcaption>Circa July 2018.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n\n        <p>After finalizing the logo's form, I coloured it with a blue-teal gradient in an attempt to convey the mentality change Rehack hopes to establish in student tech events. Since gradients can be difficut to work with graphically, especially when superimposed on top of various backgrounds, I also created monochrome variants of the logo. From the colours of the logo, I derived the colour palette, using 3 colours (including the blue and teal) as primary colours and variations of those as the supplementary colours. I also established four monochrome shades that are handy for grayscale designs and typography.</p>\n\n\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
