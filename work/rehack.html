          <h4>Introduction</h4>

          <p>In the spring of my freshman year, an <a href="https://stephencognetta.com/">alum</a> came back to campus to talk about some of his work in mental health tech. A few months later, he ran the first reverse hackathon for professionals in the Bay Area to bring together an interdisciplinary crowd to tackle problems in current tech products. I saw the event recap on his blog and realized that this was a valuable event to bring to students. More specifics on why I started Rehack can be found in <a href="https://medium.com/rehack/why-a-reverse-hackathon-and-why-now-34ac4a8c71a6?source=friends_link&sk=1a08af4d5f2e6eae3e9ffb32ccc5c3b9">this Medium article</a>.</p>

          <p>After bouncing around ideas with the alum and friends over the summer, I returned to campus in the fall and established <a href="https://rehack.co/">Rehack</a>, a student organization dedicated to putting together the first reverse hackathon for students. The goal of Rehack was (and still is) to <i>bring together students with different backgrounds and experiences to develop creative solutions that would make modern consumer tech products more fair, humane, and socially responsible.</i> I got together a small team, and after a year of hard work, productive conversations, and non-stop fundraising, we made Rehack a reality.</p>

          <p>There are countless components involved in making Rehack successful both as an organization and as an event, but I want to touch on a particular component that I focused on heavily from the very beginning up through to the day of the event and beyond: the design. Read on to find out how I built the graphical presence of Rehack, from the logo, to colour palette, to website, to printed materials!</p>

          <h4>Beginnings</h4>

          <p>Since Rehack is simultaneously a new concept and organization, it's important for the branding to be communicative, distinctive, and memorable. During freshman summer, I started by reflecting on the intent and goals behind Rehack and where exactly I wanted to take it. My thoughts basically boiled down to the following: </p>

          <p><i>Rehack's mission is to empower students to critially examine technology around them and articulate their thoughts by prototyping solutions to the problems they see. </i></p>

          <p><i>Rehack is driven by values of <b>mindfulness</b>, <b>diversity</b>, and <b>innovation</b>. Rehack aims to build a community of students with varying areas of expertise and encourage among them discussion on how to build today's technology to be more meaningful.</i></p>

          <p>These thoughts allowed me to start coming up with some graphical ideas for the logomark. I experimented with both a solely text-based logo as well as a logo that had both graphical and text components. I also played around with different graphical forms; I liked the brain because it embodies two of Rehack's main values (mindfulness and innovation) and is widely recognizable, but I also liked the idea of using only simple, geometrical forms. Through all of this, I tried to incorporate the 'reverse' part of reverse hackathon meaningfully, as that was one of Rehack's unique points. You can see some of these efforts in the initial Illustrator planning document.</p>

          <div class="row">

            <figcaption style="padding-bottom: 1rem;">Circa July 2018.</figcaption></figure>
          </div>

          <p>It was initially all done in black and white to make an isolated decision on form. I settled on the brain with a sine wave through it because the form was distinct, scalable, and meaningful: it represents the organization and event's focus on areas like digital wellbeing and human-computer interaction. Pair that up with one of the text options, and bingo! We have ourselves the beginnings of a logotype.</p>

          <h4>Colours and Typography</h4>

          <p>I chose blue and teal as two potential colours for the logo. Blue is often considered a calming colour, which fits in with some of the mental health themes that inspired Rehack, and also has a pretty unique place in the tech world with the infamous Windows blue screen of death. Someone once described teal to me as the colour of digital water, which I thought was oddly fitting and I enjoy its soothing qualities.</p>

          <p>Colouring the logo with one of those colours wasn't anything spectacular, but colouring it with a gradient of those two colours was compelling. I was working with gradients during my internship that summer, and was well aware of their over-usage in web interfaces, so I hesitated on using it for the logo. However, it carried notions of diversity and change, which I thought were important to Rehack, so I stuck with it. Later, the gradient actually caused a bit of problems when printing the logo on apparel and other swag, but that was dealt with later.</p>

            <figcaption style="padding-bottom: 1rem;">Logotype monochrome variations.</figcaption></figure>
          </div>

          <p>From this, I derived the colour palette, using 3 colours (including the blue and teal) as primary colours and variations of those as the supplementary colours. I also established four monochrome shades that are handy for grayscale designs and typography.</p>
